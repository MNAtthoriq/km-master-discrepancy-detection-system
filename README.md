A systematic framework designed to identify and prioritize discrepancies in KM Master data. This system provides **KM Master recommendations** for each store. It enables the operations team to efficiently determine and prioritize which KM Master data entries should be validated for each store.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem**

The KM Master data represents the round-trip distance between an Operating Point and a Store. It serves as a crucial reference for determining transportation costs (*Uang Jalan Pengiriman* or **UJP**).

An inaccurate KM Master can lead to significant problems: **underestimated distances** may cause operational problems, while **overestimated distances** may create opportunities for frauds. Therefore, it requires regular validation to ensure accuracy.

However, manually validating all thousands of KM Master entries for each store is highly inefficient. As a result, the operations team must prioritize which KM Master data should be validated first.

## ðŸ’¡ **Solution**

A rule-based framework that utilizes three methods to provide KM Master recommendations
1. **KM Master Method**: The user defines lower and upper bounds for KM Master data based on operational insights. Data falling outside this range will receive a KM Master recommendation manually calculated using Google Maps.
2. **KM Tempuh Method**: The system calculates KM Master recommendations based on the average KM Tempuh (actual distance) per trip. This method applies when the KM Max (the longest KM Master in a trip) is equal to the KM Master for that store.
3. **Master Zona Method**: The system calculates KM Master recommendations based on the average KM Tempuh per trip for the most frequently visited store within the same Master Zona (zone group).

The KM Master recommendation is generated by combining the results of all three methods, with credibility prioritized in the following order: KM Master, then KM Tempuh, and finally Master Zona.
